SneakerLocker is a simple CMS for your sneaker collection. Once you are signed up as a user you can add sneakers (brand, model, colorway, and cost) to create your SneakerLocker. You can also edit and delete sneakers from your collection. The app only allows you to add, edit, and delete from your own SneakerLocker.
